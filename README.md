### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am a Data Analyst Apprentice at Google and have a total of 6+ years of experience.

With my strong analytical skills, proven experience in SQL and advanced Excel, and a passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful insights, I am confident I can significantly contribute to your team's success.
For the past two years, I have honed my SQL proficiency while working at Google. I have designed and executed queries, cleansed and wrangled multiple datasets, and built data pipelines to support various business functions. My expertise in advanced Excel formulas and functions has enabled me to create dynamic reports, automate tedious tasks, and build financial models, adding immense value to my previous role.
However, my desire to explore and extend my data skills led me to delve into the world of Python. Through several personal projects, I have gained valuable experience in data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Furthermore, I have actively utilized visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI to effectively communicate data insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
